# user-engagement
This work has been done in order to identify engagement users and further classify them using xboost.
This is an end-to-end approach, from data descriptives, to actual modelling.

In "utils" python code you may find some major functions that have been created from scratch and used in the main code.
In "modelling part" you may find the entire code that the actual analysis has taken place.
